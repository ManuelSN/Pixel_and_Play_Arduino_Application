# Pixel & Play Arduino Application 

This is a part of a university project consisting of a [Neopixel Arduino Game Console](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Neopixel-Console/). In particular, here you will find a useful application developed in processing to draw your own images and display them on the RGB LED Matrix with the help of an Arduino library developed by [Ram√≥n Heras](https://github.com/ramonheras).
